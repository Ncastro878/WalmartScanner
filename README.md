# WalmartScanner
App to keep track of spending at Walmart using a bar-code scanner & WalMart's API(that is beta/still in development).

**//TODO:**

-Clean up network calls to account for bad requests(wrong barcodes, etc).

-Clean up layout(lineup columns).

-Work on Design.

-Allow for manual price entry & manual changing of quantity.

-See if we can prevent barcode scanner from returning multiple barcode numbers when multiple barcodes are present.

-Probably use a network library(retrofit) instead of Android's HTTPUrlConnection().
